        <p>I’m passionate about helping those in business to succeed.  Having worked for start-ups, mid-sized companies and fintech organizations, I got to observe and participate in the excitement of bringing ideas into action along with the inherent challenges.  
          </p>
         <p>Trained in finance with a master of science in finance from Golden Gate University, I was fortunate to have worked at Barra, a premier, fintech company founded by two Berkeley professors.  Barra applied modern portfolio theory to risk analytics for the 1300 plus world-wide investment management organizations including some of the largest mutual fund managers and pension retirement systems.  During my tenure at Barra, I began as an equity operations analyst and took on a variety of different roles with increasing responsibilities – my last position being director of a global service team responsible for assisting portfolio managers, prior to Barra’s acquisition by index giant, MSCI.
          </p>
          <p>The acquisition presented an opportunity for my family to move to the Big Island of Hawaii to embark on a new adventure.  We lived off grid in the middle of a rain forest on the slopes of Mauna Loa relying on the generosity of Mother Nature.  More than enough rain for catchment and enough sun to generate electricity to power all the modern conveniences.
          </p>
          <p>During our 14 year stay in Hawaii, I started two business, the first a solar energy company at a time when solar was starting to become mainstream.  I developed financial models that helped prospective users understand how they could benefit from the energy savings and tax credits available at that time.
          </p>
          <p>I never imagined going back into finance, especially in Hawaii. However, I became a financial advisor working with retail clients – local business owners, independent contractors and executives.  After 4 years, I established my own wealth advisory practice under Ameriprise.  During this time as I grew my practice, our boys graduated from high school and went to college on the mainland.  And after eight years in my own practice, I sold it allowing my wife, Doreen, and I to  embark on a new adventure to the Pacific Northwest.
